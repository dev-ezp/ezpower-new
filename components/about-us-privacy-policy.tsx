                    We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
                    However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology
                    can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat

                    of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

                <p className='text-sm text-justify'>
                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track &#40;&quot;DNT&quot;&#41; feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy
                    preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
                    signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
                    online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
